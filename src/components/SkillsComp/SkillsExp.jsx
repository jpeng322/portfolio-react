        post their service online for clients to book, and{" "}
        <span className={tkh}>Bloomin</span>, an informational web page where
        users can find information and incentives to be more environmentally
        sustainable. In these projects, I was able to collaborate with other
        UIUX designers and professional engineers, using  <span className={figma}>Figma</span> and  <span className={figma}>Git</span> in a team
        setting.
